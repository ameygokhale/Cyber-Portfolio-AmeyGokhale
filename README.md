# Cyber-Portfolio-AmeyGokhale
Hands-on cybersecurity portfolio: labs &amp; projects

Practical cybersecurity portfolio combining **labs** (tool-based exercises) and **projects** (end-to-end implementations).  
Covers penetration testing, network security, cloud hardening, digital forensics, embedded cybersecurity, and cryptography.

All experiments were conducted in **isolated lab environments**.  
Each folder contains detailed methodology, sanitized screenshots, and remediation recommendations.
