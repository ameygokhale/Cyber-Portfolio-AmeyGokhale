# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Amey Gokhale
Hands-on labs • Practical security projects • End-to-end assessments

This portfolio highlights my **practical, hands-on experience** across penetration testing, network security, SIEM operations, digital forensics, cryptography, malware analysis, IoT security, cloud security, and threat intelligence.

All labs were performed in **isolated, intentionally vulnerable environments**.  
Each folder includes methodology, sanitized screenshots, analysis, and remediation steps.
